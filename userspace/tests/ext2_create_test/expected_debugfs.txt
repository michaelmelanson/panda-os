# Verify filesystem state after create/unlink tests.

# Lines starting with '>' are debugfs commands.
# All other non-comment lines are expected patterns that must appear
# in order in the debugfs output.

# Test 1: newfile.txt was created and written to
>cat newfile.txt
Created by Panda!

# Test 2: created.txt was created in subdir
>cat subdir/created.txt
In subdir

# Test 4: hello.txt was unlinked — should not appear in root listing
# Use ls -l for one-entry-per-line output (plain ls wraps multiple entries
# per line, which breaks the ordered pattern matcher).
>ls -l /
subdir
large.bin
newfile.txt

# Verify subdir contains both original and created files
>ls -l subdir
nested.txt
created.txt
